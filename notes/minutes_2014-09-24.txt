also minutes from HWR+DWH+MKN meeting of prevoius day 
1) renamed APOGEE directory
2) started to consolidate different working versions of the code on laptop and aida41157
3) get plots to DWH for Monday 29 
4) DWH to look at how to parameterise how each pixel depends on labels to find most sensitive regions
5) MKN to write about training sample - I am still doing tests of this - need to justify any cuts made here and also explain only as good as training data 
6) Can exclude stars in training sample only on a physical basis. i.e. throw out the stars with log g < 0  - need to try this and run through 
7) MKN need to look at the spectra of the stars at bad places on the isochrone too - important. 
8) MKN need to look at where binaries are in this too 
9) MKN need to do a field audit - throw away bad fields for example where things like blue plume are coming in 
10) adding DFM - will lead the upgrade to Gaussian process and generally do great things. include on email thread
