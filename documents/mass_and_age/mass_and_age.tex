\begin{abstract}%
% Context
With \thecannon, we have demonstrated that it is possible to use a
small training set of stars with noisy spectral data and known
stellar-parameter labels to build a data-driven probabilistic model of
stellar spectra that can be used to infer stellar-parameter labels for
other stars (with differently noisy spectral data).
% Aims
% Method
Here we train this system using stars with known stellar mass labels
obtained from a training set of stars with both
\kepler\ asteroseismological observations (hence the known masses) and
\apogee\ infrared spectral data.
We find that (after training) \thecannon\ can infer stellar
masses---and therefore also stellar ages---for red-giant stars using
infrared spectral data alone.
We produce mass and inferred age labels for all XXX,000 red-giant stars in \apogee\ DR12 and show the age trends in the Milky Way for the \apogee\ red clump sample, which have small ($\approx$ distance errors).
% Results
We demonstrate the validity of the stellar masses and ages by three
methods:
Cross-validation demonstrates that the method obtains (log) mass accuracies of approximately 0.08~dex and (log) age accuracies
of roughly 0.25~dex for typical-quality \apogee\ spectra.
Second, we find that the spectral mass (or age) indicators
discovered by \thecannon\ are associated with elements that can be ``dredged up'',
specifically the CN regions of the spectra.
Third, we show that the ages of stellar structures in the
Milky Way follow gross expectations, even conditioned on abundances.
All three of these tests show that we can obtain red-giant mass and
age information from stellar spectra; these capabilities open up new
opportunities for Milky Way and stellar astrophysics.

\section{Introduction}\label{sec:Intro}

Asteroseismology surveys, such as \most, \corot, and \kepler, have
been extremely successful and productive in bringing us information
about stellar interiors and (therefore) ages.
These missions operate by taking high-cadence, high-precision stellar
photometry, in which stellar oscillation modes are visible in the
Fourier domain.
These missions have operated by taking long stretches of
uninterrupted, uniform, dense imaging data on thousands of individual
stars.
They are expensive missions, but absolutely critical to calibrate
physical stellar interior models and set standards for stellar
parameter estimation, all of which is required for the ultimate
success of the next generation of stellar surveys, particularly
including the \gaia\ Mission.

At the same time, there are many large spectroscopic surveys, such
as \apogee, \galah, and \gaiaeso, underway to measure the properties
of stellar \emph{exteriors}.
These surveys will take high signal-to-noise, high resolution spectra
of hundreds of thousands of stars, revealing detailed surface chemical
abundances.
One question that naturally arises is:
How do we use these two pieces of information (surface spectroscopy
and interior asteroseismology) to jointly infer stellar properties?
Another is:
Is there any way we could learn about stellar interiors from surface
spectroscopy?
After all, the marginal cost of taking a spectrum of
a new star is very low relative to the marginal cost of getting its
asteroseismology.

There are a small handful of specific metrics that have been used for inferring age information from surface spectroscopy alone. These derive from rotation, in the line-profile variations due to non-LTE effects, as convection scales with mass, and from chromospheric emission from a time-dependent magnetic field e.g. the Ca II HK and H$\alpha$ (see Soderblom 2010 for a review). The decay of long lived isotopes such as Th, which can be measured at 4019 Angstroms, can also be used for age dating by comparing the abundance of the long lived isotopes to that of the stable elements in the stellar photosphere. 

Importantly, and in general, mass and therefore inferred age might only appear in the spectra as
certain combinations of surface abundances that are highly covariant
with age.  For example, older stars in the Milky Way tend to be more
alpha-enhanced.  We will consider such age indicators illegitimate;
the purpose of this project is to obtain estimates for ages and masses \emph{that work even within narrow abundance-selected subsamples}.

Typically, age estimates for stars are more commonly determined not from spectroscopy directly, but from their measured stellar parameters (determined from high resolution stellar spectroscopy) by interpolating between stellar isochrone models, in the sub-giant and main sequence regime  (e.g. Bensby2013, Casagrande2011, Haywood20XX). In this \teff-\logg\ regime the models are the least insensitive to age.  However, the age constraints using this method are typically weak or may only provide an upper limit on the age estimate.  This method has been used to determine ages for what has been up until now the largest homogeneous data set of stellar ages in the galactic disk, from the Geneva Cophenhagen Survey (GCS). All of the 16,682 main sequence stars from GCS are located in the solar neighbourhood (Nordstršm et al. 2004).

If we can determine the interior properties of stars from surface
spectroscopy alone, even noisily, great opportunities arise for
studying the stellar populations of the Milky Way and their formation. The red clump sample alone from \apogee\ alone, for which accurate distances (to 5 percent) have been determined, comprises 20,000 stars and spans a radial extent across the disk of 4 -- 16 kpc. We use The Cannon to infer stellar masses for stars given a training set of \apokasc\ stars with known mass labels, demonstrate that the information informing the masses (and other labels) is xxx valid and demonstrate that the information in the mass and inferred age label is additional to that of chemical abundance alpha/fe proxy alone. 

present the catalogue of mass and inferred ages for these stars as well as XXXX giant stars in the DR12 data release from the \apogee\ survey. 

%, with a sample of about 16,682 stars, has been the largest sample of stars, all of which are nearby main sequence stars, with complete data on stellar ages in the Milky Way disk. These ages have been determined from the constraints set by the measured parallaxes to these stars and their stellar parameters of \teff, \logg\ and \feh,  using interpolation between stellar isochrone models \citet{Holm2009}.



%We similarly use stellar models but determine our mass directly from the spectra - and use the models to move from measured inferred mass to inferred age. Not mapping from stellar params to isochrone age space. How do I say this in a better way to describe why it is better?

%\ldots DWH: What are our hypotheses about how mass or age might appear
%in a stellar spectrum?  It might appear as dredge-up of evolved
%material from the core into the photosphere.  It might appear as
%chromospheric emission from a time-dependent magnetic field.  It might
%appear as line-shape variations as stellar rotation evolves.  It might
%appear as amplitude variations in non-LTE effects as convection scales
%are different for stars of different masses.

%\ldots DWH: Importantly, age might only appear in the spectra as
%certain combinations of surface abundances that are highly covariant
%with age.  For example, older stars in the Milky Way tend to be more
%alpha-enhanced.  We will consider such age indicators illegitimate;

%\emph{that work even within narrow abundance-selected subsamples}.

\section{Methods and data}

We make use of \tc\ \citep{Ness2015}, which is a data-driven method for
determining stellar parameters and abundances.
\tc\ is a probabilistic model of stellar spectra---meaning that it
produces a likelihood function or a probability density in spectral
space---that is itself a function of stellar parameters and chemical
abundances (which we collectively call ``labels'').
The model is not based on physical models, but is instead learned
from a training set of stars with (assumed) known labels.
This learning is called the ``training step''.
The model is used to label a new star \emph{not} in the training set
by maximizing the likelihood of the label values given the new star's
spectrum.
This labeling is called the ``test step''.
\tc\ differs from other kinds of standard machine-learning methods
(such as random forest or deep neural networks) in that it contains an
explicit likelihood function, at both the training step and the test
step, so it is able to account for heteroskedastic noise and missing
data in the spectra of both the training and test stars.

In detail, the likelihood function we use for \tc\ in this work has a
gaussian form at each measured spectral wavelength, with a mean that
is a quadratic function of the labels, and a variance that consists of
an intrinsic variance added to an observational noise variance (from
photon noise and other sources).
DWH: EQUATIONS HERE.

MKN: Put in model - is quadratic but with a cubed log g term - from empirical testing. Found that this reduced the error in the labels, most significatnly for the teff label, of 10percent. No significant gain going to higher order in the other terms. \\. 

We have shown in previous work \citep{Ness2015} that \tc\ does a good job
of modeling stellar spectra and delivering stellar parameters and
chemical abundances for stars with spectra taken by the \apogee\ project \citep{Majewski2012}. \apogee\ is an SDSS \footnote{\url{www.sdss.org}} (Eisenstein et al. 2011) infrared survey of the Milky Way disk, bulge and halo and has provided H-band spectra (1500-1700 nm) of about 150,000 stars in the public data release DR12.  Of this sample, there is a subset of stars that also have been observed by the Kepler satellite, with measurements of ${nu}_max$ and $\Delta_{nu}$, that provide stellar mass estimates for these stars in this particular Kepler field. 

%The data set used for this functional demonstration of \tc\ is that of the \apogee\ survey (Majewski et al. 2012, 2015 in prep). \apogee, part of the SDSS-III\footnote{\url{www.sdss.org}} (Eisenstein et al. 2011), is a high resolution (R $\sim$ 22,500), high signal to noise (SNR $\sim$ 100), H-band (15200-16900 \AA\footnote{Due to gaps between the instrument's three detectors, the spectra are divided into three pieces: $\sim$151500-15800~\AA, 15890-16430~\AA, and 16490-16900~\AA.}) spectroscopic survey of primarily red giant stars spanning the bulge, disk, and halo of the Milky Way \citep{Zaso2013}.  \apogee 's \aspcap\ pipeline provides the stellar labels for these stars, which include stellar parameters and multiple elemental abundances, in addition to numerous flags that warn of problems with the spectra or problems with the label determination for the spectra (or both).  This pipeline is based on $\chi^2$ fitting of the data to 1D LTE models for seven labels (\teff, \logg, \feh, [$\alpha$/Fe], [C/M], [N/M], and micro-turbulence; Garc\'{i}a~P\'{e}rez et al., 2015, in prep).

%One difference between our use of the \apogee\ data and previous work
%with the same data is in continuum estimation.

In this project, we are once again using \apogee\ data, and once again
using \tc. We work with the continuum-normalized DR12 spectra, and the method of continuum
estimation turns out to be important for performance. We use the aspcapStar files, but apply our own signal-to-noise invariant continuum normalisation by fitting a low-order polynomial to `true' continuum pixels, as described in \citet{Ness2015}. 
In addition to the 3 labels demonstrated in \citet{Ness2015} we include an \alphafe\ label and a mass label, to infer stellar masses and therefore ages, using stellar evolution models. Our five labels are provided to \tc\ in the training step, and delivered by
\tc\ in the test step.

Stellar mass is a parameter that is not usually considered visible in
spectral data; in the training set we are obtaining these stellar mass
parameters via asteroseismology.

\citep{Maraston2009}\\

In particular, the training set is taken from the \apokasc\ sample of
stars (MKN CITE).
This sample of stars are in common between the \kepler\ Mission
targets and the \apogee\ targets; they have high-quality infrared
spectra and also asterosesmological measurements.
The \kepler\ Mission (MKN CITE) took continuous, 30-min cadence (or
higher cadence) photometric observations of more than $10^5$ stars,
providing (at least for giant stars) measurements of the
asteroseismological frequencies and frequency splittings that indicate
stellar interior density structure.
The asteroseismological measurements are used---with stellar
models---to infer stellar masses and thus provide labels.

The training set of stars is a subset of 1500 stars from \citet{Martig2015}. These are \apokasc\ stars, with \numax\ and \deltanu\ measurements from \kepler, with corresponding spectra in the H-band across 1.5-1.7 $\micron$ at a resolution of R $\sim$ 22,500, observed as part of the \apogee\ survey. These stars have been selected with no warning or error in the \aspcap\ \code{FLAG} parameter provided by \apogee\ \citep{Ahn2014}, with no rotation flag set and with errors on the delta$\_$nu and nu$\_$max less than 5\,percent. These stars comprise a high signal-to-noise (SNR) sample, with an average SNR $\approx$ 330 $\pm$ 155. 

Five labels are used for training of \tc, the \teff, \logg, \feh, \alphafe\ and Mass. The training labels adopted were the \aspcap-corrected \citep{Meszaros2013} values for the \teff, \feh\ and \alphafe\ and the astroseismic value for \logg, as determined from the measured $\nu_{max}$ . The mass label was determined using the standard seismic scaling relation given in \ref{eqn1} \citep{SilvaAguirre2011,Chaplin2011}.

\begin{equation} \label{eq:mass}
M= \left( \frac{\nu_{\mathrm{max}}}{\nu_{\mathrm{max,\odot}}}\right)^3\  \left( \frac{\Delta \nu}{\Delta \nu_{\odot}}\right)^{-4} \ \left( \frac{T_{\mathrm{eff}}}{T_{\mathrm{eff,\odot}}}\right)^{1.5} \ .
\label{eq1}
\end{equation}
We adopt  $T_{\mathrm{eff,\odot}}=5777$ K, $\nu_{\mathrm{max,\odot}}=3140\ \mu$Hz, $\Delta \nu_{\odot}=135.03\ \mu$Hz. The solar values  $\Delta \nu_{\odot}$ and $\nu_{\mathrm{max,\odot}}$ are the ones used to build the APOKASC catalogue and were obtained by \cite{Hekker2013} with the OCT method.

The intersect spectra (0th coefficient) is plotted at top and the coefficients for the 5 labels are plotted in the bottom panels.  The left panel includes some of the elements corresponding to the absorption lines. The IR spectral region is highly blended with molecular features and most lines are a blend including CN, C2 and OH features. The maximum amplitude of the \logg\ coefficient does not correspond to the core of the absorption feature of the intersect spectrum but rather the wings. As \logg\ increases, these wings broaden and deepen. Consersely, the panel on the right hand side is the second highest amplitude of the \logg\ coefficient but is positive, The feature this correlates with is the Brackett feature, which becomes shallower and flatter with increasing \logg.
