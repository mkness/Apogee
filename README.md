# The Cannon
 just add a perfunctory change

A method for building data-driven models for high-resolution stellar spectra.
Designed with *APOGEE2*, *Gaia-ESO*, *RAVE* and *HERMES* data in mind, but applicable generally.

## Philosophy

*Annie Jump Cannon* successfully organized stellar spectra into the OBAFGKM sequence without stellar models.
Indeed, her data-driven understanding of stellar spectra made subsequent theoretical work possible.
We don't need complete and accurate stellar models to make important new progress on all stellar astrophysics projects.

Although **The Cannon** is fully data driven, it does not follow the usual pattern of "machine learning".
At it's core, **The Cannon** is a generative model (forward model) of noisy spectrographic data.
For this reason, it is very forgiving in the face of substantial noise, missing and heterogeneous data,
and low signal-to-noise. 

## Sub-projects

- Empirical models for stellar spectra.
- Data-driven label transfer by supervised methods.
- Creation of a standard-star-based chemical abundance system.
- Cross-calibration of stellar surveys using co-observed stars.
- Probabilistic training of models with noisy labels.
